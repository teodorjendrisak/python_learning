**Summary of Feedback from ChatGPT:**

* **Functionality:** Core loop, menu, all operations, and file persistence work correctly. Duplicate handling, lookup, update, delete, and alphabetical listing behave as intended.

* **Formatting:** Consistent indentation, readable menu and separators, clear input/output prompts.

* **Pythonic Style & Suggestions:**

  * Simplify `if number.isdigit() == True:` → `if number.isdigit():`.
  * In `add_contact`, re-ask `choice_update` inside the loop to handle invalid input.
  * Remove redundant `return phonebook` from functions modifying the dictionary in place.
  * Variable names can be shortened (`name_update`, `name_delete`, `name_lookup` → `name`) for clarity.
  * Iterate directly over sorted items: `for name, number in sorted(phonebook.items()):`.
  * In `load_phonebook`, place `return phonebook` after the `with` block for convention.

Overall: functional, meets requirements, minor cleanups recommended for conciseness and Pythonic clarity.
